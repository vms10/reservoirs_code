# This file contains the list of regulation interactions (graph edges) that
# define the gene regulatory network of Bacillus subtilis.
# 
# The original network was built using the information available from
# 
# Sierro N, Makita Y, de Hoon M, Nakai K. DBTBS: a database of transcriptional
# regulation in Bacillus subtilis containing upstream intergenic conservation
# information. Nucleic acids research. 2008;36(Database issue):D93â€“6.
# doi:10.1093/nar/gkm910.
# 
# Columns:
# 1. regulator gene
# 2. target or regulated gene
# 3. If available in the original source, effect of the regulation: activatory
# (+) or inhibitory (-). Context dependent or unknown effects where assumed to
# be activatory.
